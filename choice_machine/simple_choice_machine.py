"""
This is the simple choice engine. the first part of the Stat engine. Its a simple python script that takes
in user inputs for what they want, also takes in a scale.

Goal; to simulate a dice role where you can cheat based on how much you want something.
The more choices you enter, the more heads the dice gets!

basically a choice engine for indecisive people (like me!)
